Volume Renderer is a simple volume rendering program based on VTK and Qt.
Widgets from CTK (www.commontk.org) are used to display property of volume data.

** 2015-09-14 Update: This project is successfully built with CMake 3.6, VTK 6.3, Qt 5.5.1 and Visual Studio 2013. **

** The CTK widgets in this project are only a small subset of the CTK library downloaded on 14 September 2015 from https://github.com/commontk/CTK **
